- Docker deployment configuration.
- AI Builder generation engine and production AI provider integrations.

## Application & Workspace Architecture Status

- **Current Applications**: `apps/web` only.
- **Current Packages / Modules / Services**: No shared `packages`, business `modules`, or backend `services` are currently implemented.
- **Database Status**: Not implemented; no database connection verified.
- **Migration Status**: Not implemented; no migration system verified.
- **Authentication Status**: Not implemented.
- **Authorization Status**: Not implemented.
- **Test Status**: `pnpm test` verified, but no test tasks are currently defined. Turborepo reports `0 successful, 0 total`. Automated test coverage is not yet implemented.
- **TypeScript Status**: Verified passing through the Next.js production build.
- **Lint Status**: Verified passing with `pnpm lint`.
- **Build Status**: Verified passing with `pnpm build`.
- **Docker Status**: Not implemented.
- **VPS / Deployment Status**: Repository cloned and verified at `/root/lwill-ai-builder` on the KVM4 VPS. No LWILL production deployment has been verified or configured.

## Environment & Dependency Requirements

- **Verified Windows Node.js**: `v24.18.0`
- **Package Manager**: `pnpm@11.20.0` (strictly mandatory).
- **Core Commands**:
  - `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
  - `pnpm test`
  - `pnpm lint`
  - `pnpm build`

## Known Issues

- No automated test suite currently exists.
- Database, migrations, authentication, and authorization are not implemented.
- Production deployment is not configured.
- Dyad preview currently has a root Turborepo `--port` forwarding incompatibility; this does not affect verified `pnpm lint` or `pnpm build`.

## Do-Not-Modify Areas

- Do not introduce business functionality during Phase 0A.
- Do not replace the existing Next.js/Turborepo/pnpm foundation without verified architectural justification.
- Do not introduce `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`.
- Do not fabricate implementation or production-readiness claims.
- Do not hard-code the current two X Nail branches.

## Exact Next Task

1. Finish Phase 0A documentation verification.
2. Establish automated baseline tests before core business implementation.
3. Design Phase 1 authentication, tenant hierarchy, permissions, and database foundation from verified requirements.

## Phase 1A Prisma Migration Baseline Verification

- Initial Prisma migration baseline generated from the existing schema only.
- Migration directory: `packages/database/prisma/migrations/0_init`.

- Migration baseline consistency verification: Passed locally against the current Prisma schema.
- PostgreSQL connection: Not performed; no live production database was connected.
- Database migration application: Not performed; the baseline was created and validated locally only.
- Authorization behavior, authentication, middleware, landing page, and ERP functionality were not modified or implemented.
- Next development target: Apply the migration only after a separately authorized PostgreSQL environment is available and verified.

## Phase 1B Authentication + Tenant Context Foundation

### Status: **Complete — All verifications passed**

### Implemented Files

**New package: `packages/authentication-context/`**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `package.json` | Package manifest (`@lwill/authentication-context`) |
| `tsconfig.json` | Strict TypeScript config (`exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`) |
| `src/types.ts` | Core contracts: `AuthenticatedUser`, `TenantContext`, `AuthenticationSession`, `UnauthenticatedSession`, `AuthenticationContext`, `AuthenticationProvider` |
| `src/unauthenticated.ts` | `UNAUTHENTICATED` constant |
| `src/tenant-context-validator.ts` | `TenantHierarchyVerifier` interface + `validateTenantContext()` function |
| `src/index.ts` | Barrel re-exports |
| `src/auth-context.test.ts` | 6 deterministic type-contract tests |
| `src/tenant-context-validator.test.ts` | 7 deterministic hierarchy-validation tests |

**New files in `apps/web/`**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/lib/auth/server-context.ts` | Server-only boundary; resolves `AuthenticationContext`; fails closed; no secrets exposed to client |
| `src/lib/auth/authorization-boundary.ts` | Server-only integration bridge connecting `AuthenticationContext` → `@lwill/authorization-service` |
| `src/test/server-context.test.ts` | 4 deterministic server-context tests |
| `src/test/authorization-boundary.test.ts` | 7 deterministic authorization-boundary tests |
| `src/test/__mocks__/server-only.ts` | Vitest stub for the `server-only` package |

**Modified files**

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `apps/web/package.json` | Added `server-only`, `@lwill/authentication-context` (deps); `@lwill/authorization`, `@lwill/authorization-service` (devDeps) |
| `apps/web/vitest.config.mts` | Added `resolve.alias` to stub `server-only` in Vitest |
| `apps/web/next.config.ts` | Added `transpilePackages: ["@lwill/authentication-context"]` |
| `pnpm-lock.yaml` | Updated for new `server-only` dependency |
| `docs/PROJECT-STATUS.md` | Updated HEAD commit and added this section |

### Authentication Provider Status

**No real authentication provider has been connected yet.**

The `AuthenticationProvider` interface in `packages/authentication-context/src/types.ts` defines the contract. The `setAuthenticationProvider()` function in `apps/web/src/lib/auth/server-context.ts` registers the provider at startup. No JWT, OAuth, session cookie, or password-based provider has been implemented or integrated. The system always returns `UnauthenticatedSession` until a provider is registered.

### Tenant Context Status

A deterministic, provider-neutral `validateTenantContext()` function enforces the full `Tenant → BusinessUnit → Branch` hierarchy through an injected `TenantHierarchyVerifier` interface. The concrete verifier (database-backed via Prisma) has not been implemented yet — a live PostgreSQL instance is required for that step.

### Authorization Integration Status

`apps/web/src/lib/auth/authorization-boundary.ts` connects `AuthenticationContext` to `@lwill/authorization-service`. `userId` and `tenantId` are drawn exclusively from the validated session — never from client-supplied input. The boundary fails closed on any error, missing context, or unauthenticated state.

### Tests Added

| Package / Location | Test File | Count |
|-------------------|-----------|-------|
| `@lwill/authentication-context` | `src/auth-context.test.ts` | 6 |
| `@lwill/authentication-context` | `src/tenant-context-validator.test.ts` | 7 |
| `apps/web` | `src/test/server-context.test.ts` | 4 |
| `apps/web` | `src/test/authorization-boundary.test.ts` | 7 |
| **Total new tests** | | **24** |

**Test coverage by requirement:**

- ✅ Unauthenticated context
- ✅ Authenticated user context
- ✅ Missing tenant context
- ✅ Valid tenant context
- ✅ Invalid tenant/business-unit relationship
- ✅ Invalid business-unit/branch relationship
- ✅ Cross-tenant context rejection
- ✅ Expired session rejection
- ✅ Fail-closed authorization integration
- ✅ No client-controlled tenant escalation

### Verification Results

```
pnpm test  — 45 tests, 8 test files, 0 failures
pnpm lint  — Passed
pnpm build — Passed (TypeScript compilation + Next.js production build)
tsc --noEmit (packages/authentication-context) — Passed (0 errors)
git diff --check — No trailing whitespace errors
```

### Known Limitations

- No real authentication provider is connected. Production authentication (JWT, OAuth, session cookie) must be implemented in a future phase.
- `TenantHierarchyVerifier` has no concrete database-backed implementation. A Prisma-based verifier must be created once a live PostgreSQL instance is available.
- `server-only` enforcement is active in the Next.js production build; test execution relies on a Vitest stub.

**No production database has been connected or migrated.**

### Next Phase

Phase 1C: Implement a Prisma-backed `TenantHierarchyVerifier` and register a concrete `AuthenticationProvider` (e.g., JWT/session cookie reading from HTTP headers, validated server-side). Do not connect to production database without a separate verified PostgreSQL environment.
